# Text Personality and Emotion Computing

This is the code, dataset and prediction information for a research project that aims to investigate the relationship between personality and emotions in automated personality and emotion detection.

The adressed questions of the study are:
- How accurately can automated models predict personality traits and emotions from text data?
- How related are the correlations between annotated and predicted personality traits and emotions?
- How consistent are the correlations from annotated data with the correlations reported in established personality and emotion theories?

All the code developed was run on GoogleColab with a GPU type T4.
