The results of the fire could have been worse. I'm just glad nobody died.  Stuff can always be replaced.  Burns are the worst since they're so painful.  Hopefully these people have some family they can stay with until they're able to find a new housing situation. That's great that the firemen were able to get the fire under control so quickly.,5.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0
"I am thankful that there are people who care about this issue, but I really don't. I feel like this is just part of the life-cycle and I don't really get why so much money is being wasted on a problem and isn't necessarily crucial. However, as I said, it's probably good that people who know more about this issue than I do are caring about the problem.",6.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,3.0
"Aww, I hope this story isn't really true.  I mean do people still go to see elephants perform anywhere?  And people have been so much more vocal and worried about animals for quite a long time, I just have trouble believing that this story is true.  I hope not.  Plus, do elephants really live that long?",5.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,5.0
I am not sure what to think. I would be happy to be alive. I would like to know if they knew what the sea would be like as the sea is VERY unpredictable and I doubt they wanted to kill themselves too. I think it's a tragedy and no one is at fault. It is just one of those things that happens. Some things and tragedies are unforeseeable.,4.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,6.0
"Wow.. You have to check this out.  There was a horrible accident on a family type Water Ride in Gold Coast Austrailia.  4 People were killed..2 women ages 42 and 32 I think, also two men, 38, and 35,.  This is what happened...2 people were ejected from the raft and the other 2 were trapped inside..they all died.  The park was shut down.

"I just read an article about 500 people being killed in an earthquake.  I feel so blessed that I live in a state where I don’t fear earthquakes, or severe tornado warnings, flash floods or major disasters. Of course Vermont has had our issues and weather events that caused damage, however we’re not in a region of the world where we fear for our lives at certain months of the year. I could not imagine being terrified for my children, property, and family like some of these families are. Living through an experience like that, must leave behind emotional scars while growing up.",6.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,5.0
Some scum bag is at it again stealing naked pictures of people simply because they are celebrities and he can make money from doing it.  It blows my mind the level of shit people will do in order to make a buck.   It seems like people treat celebrities as if they are not people at all.  People that leave negative comments on celebrity pages are taking it to a new level.  People say the shittiest things to each other when they're hiding behind their computer screen.   This particular guy took it to the extreme by stealing their private photos.,5.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,6.0
"I'm at a loss for words when I think of all the senseless lives lost from gun violence. As a gun supporter maybe I should take a step back and ask myself the hard questions about guns and there impact and availability in today's society. I know that statistically more people die from other causes compared to gun violence, but are guns way to accessible in America compared to other countries? When the 2nd amendment was written could they imagine the way guns could have progressed or how they are being used today? Seeing so many mass shootings makes me feel that maybe it's time to change some of the gun laws and help make things like 40 children killed or injured a thing of the past.",5.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,5.0
"Gah. The whole Ke$ha mess. Oops, I man Kesha, without the $ sign. I dunno what to think about the eating disorder and whole rehab thing.

She just seems to have that kind of personality.",5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,3.0
"These poor people.  I hope the researchers can find a way to help them.  The thought that you can't even use the water that is deep in the ground due to arsenic contamination is horrible.

I don't know much about cricket but apparently in England it's a very big deal!  This one town's team is under the gun to win the championship and needs only 33 more points to pull it off.

"Wow, I just read an article that says coconuts could be in danger of becoming much more scarce.  There is a bacteria going around that causes lethal yellowing and wipes them out.

I just read this article about a wolf being killed after traveling 700 miles  by a government agent . I don't understand it ! There was no reason for it . It hadn't  attacked or disturbed anyone so what was the point of it all ? I feel like anymore people just kill animals to kill . This is why one day so these animals will be extinct .

I saw a horrible story about a turtle on line today. A man took a hammer and beat a large turtle to death . He broke the shell on it's back and crushed it's head with the hammer. I hope they give that vile excuse for a human being the maximum sentence. I love turtles. They are so unique and cool to watch.

"That's incredibly disgusting. I feel like it should count as a hate crime, and everyone on that boat who had anything to do with that incident should be brought before a judge and made to answer for their involvement.

"It is really sad the way that people only see one side of the story of the Afghan war.  We only see things from our side of the pond, and we see the good , but not all of the bad that we do, as a country.  We tend to think of things, in generalities, and lump groups of people who live in a common area, into one pile of terrorists.  There are plenty of people in Afghanistan who are against eh taliban, and we dont see the damage that we are doing by hitting them with drone strikes.  Most casualties in wars are civilians , who had nothing to do with the conflict itself.  There are always conflicting stories about the death tolls.

Upward of 10 billion gallons of mud filled with mining waste buried towns in the Nov. 5 dam break that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in Latin America’s largest country. Nineteen people perished. Across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of New York City’s Central Park — the onslaught of mud crushed thousands of trees and wildlife. In the river, more than 14 tons of fish died, mostly after mud got stuck in their gills. An equally large amount of aquatic plants die",5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0
There are a lot of older people in Russia who survived the Second World War who are now trying their best to survive.  Many estimates say that there are a lot of people in Russia who survived only on $4.50 a day.  With this little money they do not have the luxury of going out to eat.  Also when living on so little money it is dangerous because of Health Care problems.  If one has to  have surgery or even get expensive medication it can be a real setback to their life style.

The fact of the matter is these people are using religion as an excuse to rape and kill woman and children, and thats one of the most unmoral and unethical things I can think of. These poor women and children are not only kidnapped and drugged, but they are also dealing with being raped and having their loved ones killed.

"Muslim immigration seems to have some unique issues.  I think the solution is to hold off with allowing much Muslim immigration until Muslims start polling better on ideas involving apostates, etc.  As evidenced by polls (even in European countries), the ideas Muslims accept put them at odds with basic educational values.  I think seeking a professional to talk and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing.  The right therapy can likely help certain people.    What concerns me is living situations that are unhealthy for economic reasons, and psychological problems concerning motivation.  I suspect some mental issues may not be helped by seeing a professional.",5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0

It sucks that they had to shoot the gorilla, but it didn't know what it was doing to hurt the kid and it seemed like there was no choice but to kill him.

The indonisian government is not doing enough to protect some forest land. The orangantans who number seven fifty to seventeen fifty will be completly wiped out if the company that is clearing this land is allowed to continue. What can we do to form a protest  or let the government know that this is not right.Can you help me with some ideas?   Maybe we email the indonesian government first or attempt to call them. After that maybe we can plan to picket or have a demonstration at the capitol building voicing our concerns. Do you feel the same about this that I do? if you dont I will get someone else to help me or I will go it alone.  I just feel so strongly that something productive needs to be done and fast.

Kylie Jenner pretending like she cares about other people.  She makes a transparent marketing move to promote her own product by making up reasons other companies products are bad.

It is truly unfortunate that they live n a place where the need to ""own"" land comes at the cost of this girls eyesight.

They should be punished accordingly, a dark cell with a toilet and a meal of prison mush twice a day would serve them just right. It's a typical story about wealthy and elite out there, who always harm the innocents and somehow able to get away and proven ""innocent"".

Yet this is a man for who all intents and purposes is an American, raised here from the age of three and facing deportation for missed paperwork? This is quite frankly a steaming pile of bullshit. There are those who come here, infest neighborhoods and take away jobs from hard working Americans and then there are victims of bureaucratic anarcho-tyranny like this. These types of scenarios are unacceptable.  I tend to believe that a system that will let the guilty go free is preferable to one that will punish even one innocent man.

There is an intense struggle at the moment for them to maintain their crops and to keep them going. The warm temperatures have really threw a wrench into their day to day operations and maintaining the coffee crops has become quite a challenge. We are in danger of either paying really high prices on coffee or worse case scenario being without coffee period. This is very distressing for me. Can you imagine not having our cup of coffee daily to get us through the days? This is truly tragic.",5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0

The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.",5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0
This article about the Philippines mayor is very alarming. It is a shame that so many people resort to corruption and bad deeds. It is also unfortunate that it had to end in casualties.

Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money.

I feel like some people are not as responsible as they should be, and that goes for anything.

It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is.
