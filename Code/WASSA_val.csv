i could care less what isis does as long its not done in my country. I think they should all be put to death and be done with it. They are a terrorist group and deserve all the bad things that are going to happen to them. I do feel bad for the lose of life and feel sympathy for the families of the officers killed.,anger,4,4,5,4,4
"Man, car crashes happen all the time. There is no way they can be prevented. I would like to think that the smart cars of the future would help prevent this, but I am not to sure. Somebody could probably hack those and cause massive car wrecks as well. People should also drive safer as well. There is definitely too much speeding. I wonder if drunk driving was the cause of the wreck. That's a huge problem that causes a bunch of wrecks. Don't drink and drive people.",anger,6,1,1,5,5
"There has got to be a better solution that we can all come up with to make sure that these deaths are stopped or at least decreased. I understand making sure that the elephants are safe, but people should take priority as well. There are people fearing for their lives. What can their country do about it, and if their country can't, when will another country come in and offer their assistance?",,7,7,7,7,7
"Wow. Here we go again, I guess????  A couple of years ago that area in Tennessee was completely devastated by uncontrollable wildfires. Many people lost their lives and their homes. Many businesses were also destroyed. I hope this fire wasn't like that one.  A group of kids who were playing with matches in the woods set it on fire. They fled the area and told no one",,3,4,2,4,5
I understand why this is a problem but I don't see any reason to get upset over it. It seemed like they were writing about it with more emotion than the situation deserves. Trees die all the time. They're replaced by something else. It's extremely common. I get that it's worth given current climate conditions but still.,surprise,4,4,1,2,3
That is really sad to hear. It's awful that cars can be so unsafe and sometimes people forget how easy it is to get into an accident if everyone isn't careful and observant. It said this happened at 6:30pm so I wonder if maybe the sun was shining right in someone's eyes because that has happened to me at sunset and I could barely see. It's difficult to pull over and stop in those conditions as well.,surprise,5,5,1,5,4
i think we all need to do a better job of taking care of are forest and water ways because we rely on these to surive and if we are killing animals and fish the wrong way and they start to go away it could have a big impact on us and by that time it could be to late to do anything about it. so we need to put laws in that will help the animals but also help allow us to fish for them the right way not by taking a shortcut,sadness,4,3,4,5,3
"Hey, I wanted to share this article with you that I just found.  It is about the issue with junk food ads and targeting kids.  We were talking about this the other day.  Well apparently it will not be ending any time soon.  It is a billion dollar industry and there is very little anyone can do about it.  There are organizations out there that is trying to prevent this and fight against childhood obesity.  The WHO organization is blaming video bloggers/vloggers who get paychecks from junk food companies.  They are claiming that they are more powerful than ads.  I'm not sure I believe that but it could be possible, you think?",fear,7,6,1,4,7
"As someone who works in healthcare I have not encountered THIS type of thing yet, but everyone has an embarrassing story and while the ER may have not seen the exact same thing, they've likely seen crazier, just own it and GO IN. you can always tell people about your own embarrassing experience in third person, much better than losing a limb, organ or your life.",surprise,5,5,7,5,6
"This is just more of the western world becoming cold and inhospitable. Britain and France are both implicated in the troubles in these countries from their years as colonialists. Turning their back on these people is a mark of shame for them. It's despicable to let these people live in squalor and then to call it a jungle, as if this is 'wild' is kind of sick. The wild would have more respect and be more amenable to these people.",disgust,6,7,5,6,6
"Honestly it seems that the world is and has been providing a place for many refugees from all over for some time. I find it annoying that despite the people from africa and the middle east being evacuated from theyre previous worse situations they still feel the need to incite riot and cause chaos and show not only ungratefulness, but barbarity.",anger,6,6,5,7,4
This is such a terrible thing to happen to so many people. I wonder how a town can meaningfully bounce back and rebuild their lives. I don't know what I would do if this happened to me. Move? Work on recreating the city? Turn to the government for hope? It just seems so overwhelming and impossible. I feel so grateful to have avoided such an experience. I wonder if there is anything I can do to help.,surprise,5,7,6,3,6
"Clearly, this was an opinion piece.  It is upsetting that so many try to pass off an opinion piece as a news article these days.  That is exactly what fake news is.  The writer wasn't even trying to hide it.  She included ""hhhhhhmmmmmmm,  hhhmmmm,  hhhmmmm"" as part of her article.  LMFAO.  That is when there was not longer any reason to take it seriously anymore.  Sure, some of the info in there may be accurate, but the bias overwhelms all.",disgust,6,4,3,6,5
"When he was born, my son tested for elevated lead levels in his blood, and we don't live near Chicago. We were more than a bit scared, and tried to help him learn not to stick things in his mouth. Lead damage is not reversible, and we lived in an old house. To think that every day people are drinking water with as much lead as indicated is a bit disturbing - and it's not going to be cheap to fix.",fear,5,4,3,4,5
"This article highlights the fact that we might be going on about our lives, secure in the knowledge that everything is fine, but then suddenly when you least expect it, we are reminded of our own mortality. It makes me want to live each and every day as well as I can, because I never know if it might be my last. Sometimes we think we have forever, but this article is a reminder that each day we live on this Earth, imperfect though it may be, is a gift.",surprise,6,7,4,5,6
Hey dude did you see that article that come out about police torture in chicago? It's pretty crazy and damning - it's one thing to know this kinda thing has been going on but its another thing to see all of these actual documents talk about willingly torturing people AND that it's still going on today. How disgusting.,disgust,7,4,1,6,3
"It hurts to know that those children may have lost their parents in their ordeal and that they may be put into the ""system"" where they're passed around multiple families before they find a loving home. I wonder if they have relatives that might be willing to take them in. I wish the article had been more informative and told a more comprehensive story about what happened and why the children were spared when three adults were killed. Perhaps there was a spat between the adults involved and the children ended up witnessing a traumatic incident. Either way, no good comes out of this entire situation.",surprise,5,2,1,3,4
These poor birds. We need to start recycling more and making sure our plastics are at least cut up. The beads in the plastic seem to be a good idea to try and detour the birds from eating it. All these simply thing we as humans can be doing to prevent these terrible things from happening. I feel like recycling and people having knowlegde about these plastics and polluting our environment are everywhere for Americans to see.i just kind of wonder the countries that had the highest percent of plastic in their oceans do they educate or inform those countries like america does? Why are those country so much higher then the others what do we need to do to reduce that number?,surprise,6,6,4,5,6
"Avoid reading this article.  It's so fucking long for saying so little.  The author feels the need to go on and on about irrelevant details and it comes off as the ramblings of a skito out on the street corner.  It's the same nonsense the media pushes about those poor kids, but doesn't delve into how none of this shit would have happened if people were responsible and didn't make shit choices that are obviously bad.",anger,4,5,7,7,1
"How horrible! I don't care what crime anyone has committed, beating a person and then setting them on fire is detestable! I hope and pray that the authorities will be able to find out where this video originated from and bring the perpetrators to justice! It makes me sick that a human being could do that to another human!",anger,5,2,3,4,6
"I heard about a rock climber who died in Vietnam trying to scale it's highest mountain.  I remember we've talked about going on vacation there.  Sadly it was a young guy, 22, not much younger than us.  It's a really tragic story because he was on the trip with his girlfriend and when it went off on his own he became lost.  In his final moments they were actually in contact through texting.",surprise,7,7,4,7,7
I honestly cant remember what i read. I walked away for a drink and came back and i completely forgot. Reading these articles like this in succession is tedious and makes the stories asll run together making the retention of the story hard to keep. I would have reread the article if i could and there was an option to,sadness,3,4,4,4,4
"This kind of stuff is definitely very political because it shows how corrupt the Venezuelan government is very corrupt.  I get that every country has their own issues, but what happened here is absolutely ridiculous! Wouldn't want to live here at all. You guys should check this out whenever you get a chance.",anger,5,7,5,5,4
"It's scary to think that even somebody who is as well known and guarded as Kim Kardashian can still be the victim of crimes like this. It's got to be disheartening to be Kim and know you've spent (most likely) a lot of money to have security with you at all times to protect you from things like this, yet it still happens to you. You'd have to wonder just how much more one can do to protect themselves.",fear,7,7,4,7,5
"Can you believe this article? The more I read this article the more disgusted I got with what had been done to this kitten. This is a awful story that deserves to be heard by more people to make sure that the the kitten receives justice, and that the person who did this is not allowed to hurt any more animals. I think it is a great thing that this person is not allowing for someone to get away with this and making sure that others will stand with him and not allow this crime to go unpunished. I think it would be great if you could share this story and let others know so something like this can be stopped in the future.",disgust,6,6,2,5,6
"It is very tragic to hear this news regarding the circumstances that many animals are facing in various zoos across the globe. It seems that human nature is causing these animals to be subjected to lives they shouldn't have to endure. If they were released into nature then maybe they would have a fighting chance but at the same time, most of them have been raised in the zoo perhaps so their ""social skills"" in nature may be quite the detriment as well. I just wish that some organization(s) could rescue them and take care of them the way they ought to be. No animal should really have to live in a zoo, to begin with, and now they are suffering from malnourishment and lack of care. It is tragic to read about this but it is the world in which we live.",surprise,6,5,3,6,5
"Did you hear about the airstrikes in Yementi? I can't believe it. i would have been petrified!   Forty three people were killed, but could be up to sixty.. The bodies were just laying everywhere.and they were covering them with blankets.    This is just one count of those that died. Since the battle has been going on they say over 10,000 people have died from this conflict, many just innocent civilians.  I can't imagine being in that situation.",fear,7,7,4,4,7
"It's sad these days how often police are being attacked for just being police.  Mental health is such a problem, we need to find better ways to help people so they don't get to the point of harming others.  Whenever I hear about an officer being hurt I think of your husband.  We are very lucky men like him are choosing to spend their lives to protect us.  I hope we can get help to more people so I can stop worrying if there is someone out there waiting for him.",surprise,7,5,3,5,7
"There was just a 5.0 earthquake in Oklahoma. Fortunately, no one was badly injured. I didn't even know they had earthquakes there. It must be very scary to have to go through one of those. I'm glad we don't have them here. We used to have drills at school, in the event of an earthquake, but that just seems like a waste of time. I've never even been through one.",fear,4,4,7,3,5
"Is Val Kilmer healthy or not? Seems as though comments keep being made about his health and now Michael Douglas has even said something about him. Although, just because the two worked together on The Ghost and the Darkness (one of the best movies ever!) doesn't give him the right to make public comments about Kilmer's health whether it's true or not. Maybe he doesn't want the whole world to know if he's going through something.",sadness,7,5,1,4,4
"I am crushed after hearing about the conditions in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew hit the area.   The people are literally starving to death and the injured and sick do not have access to enough, if any medical care.  There are areas that are completely inaccessible to aid, either medically or food or water supplies.  There is extensive looting in Haiti and the situation is extremely dangerous even for those that try to bring in supplies to the people living there.   My heart is breaking as I think of all the people, children and adults in Haiti.  It is a country that still has not recovered from the earthquake that happened there years before.   I think that our country should continue to report on these terrible conditions and try to get aid to Haiti from every source available.",fear,7,7,6,6,7
"hey whats going on Jacob? I want to tell vent out something I read in this article.  There was a Saudi-led coalition that is backed by the US, they had led an attack in Yemen, that had killed around 43 people.  This is sad to hear so much killing in this world.  According to what I read this happened because they are trying to take someone out of power and they are trying to bring in a new leader, I think his name is Abed Rabbo Mansour.  The USA wants to put him in there.  Also they are more people dying from the long conflict, people are starving and also Planes had attacked a funeral place and they had killed people there as well.  All this necessary killing is not good for this word.  This is really, really bad that we need war to solve problems.",surprise,7,6,3,6,6
"Hello Friend. I am really very surprised at all the things that have happened and continue and continue to happen in the world. Now the big problem we are facing in this part of the United States of America is a new outbreak or virus. The specialists in the field of health still do not know what this problem is due to and how to stop it. Here I write part of what I have learned on the subject. This started in November and the symptoms are fever, a lot of chills, and difficulty to breathe",,5,4,2,2,4
"This is really ridiculous. A lawyer with a history of being a nut job went crazy at the mall in Houston Texas and shot nine people, and one of them was injured critically. And all this just because of some issues he was having where he worked, like it is so hard for a lawyer to just move on to another firm instead of going crazy and shooting up innocent people.",anger,1,7,1,2,1
"How terrible it would be to live your life knowing you murdered someone. It would be interesting to speak to somebody, who was maybe sixty or seventy, and had murdered someone as a young person, what they would have to say about it, how they feel about it and what they've learned, having killed someone, about themselves and society.",fear,3,6,4,1,4
"So I feel birth is birth. What difference does it make it you gave it vaginal or c-section. So people can be so evil in this world. You were pregnant and carried that baby in your belly for 8 to 9 months. Some ladies are faced with a life or death even choice. We have to do what is right for our babies but mostly for ourselves. I know you think wow selfish much, No this i why. If you are not here you can not raise and happy healthy family. Next if you are not your best or at 100% you really can not give your all.",anger,3,7,6,4,7
"I'm sorry to hear what happened to the people in the pulse shooting. It is not justified to use violence against anyone who has not initiated violence towards you.  That being said I understand why the authorities would want to ban people who practice risky lifestyles from donating blood.  The last thing we want is to have a blood supply that's contaminated with diseases because of the practices of people who engage in risky lifestyle choices and also sinful ones as well.  No violence should never be the answer to people no matter what their lifestyle, But one should never condone something that is bad for society in the long run.",surprise,6,5,4,6,7
Remembering those who have lost their lives due to violence is so important. Do you remember what happened in Paris in 2015? I am so grateful that the people there set aside a special time to remember all the victims and their families. Such a senseless loss. People just wanting to enjoy some entertainment were met with a horrific experience and families were forced to wait in pain to hear news of the outcome. I am sure they will never forget that day.  I do hope each day gets easier for them and that they remember the good memories of their loved ones.,surprise,7,3,3,5,6
"It is unfortunate that Venezuela seems to go through so much as a country due to politics. I do not know why the United States of America will not be more proactive in helping this less fortunate country. A lot of people complain about Chavez, but that seems to be when the country was the most stable.",surprise,5,7,4,7,6
Climate change isn't just about affect the weather negatively for future generations. It apparently will also affect food sources. We may be able to overcome this with our technology and science but will our food turn into frankenfood that could potentially have long term side effects that cannot be seen yet? Underdeveloped countries are especially going to be affected by diminishing crops due to climate change.,fear,2,2,2,2,2
I think this family had more then enough warning and notice not to go into that hot spring area. the young man fell and scalded himself to death while his sister/friend sat there and videotaped the whole thing. i dont understand some peoples logic. what made them think this was ok? what made them think they would be ok and what made them thing that parks put boundaries up jsut because they think its funny.,disgust,5,6,6,5,6
"Why are they prescribing things like that to such young kids? That's so insane. Benzodiazepines, especially, shouldn't be prescribed in general, in my opinion. Doctors are overly calm about the things they prescribe to people, people that young shouldn't be subjected to that, and the death tolls aren't surprising.",anger,3,6,4,1,4
"I feel bad for these sisters' family. Until we find out more from the autopsy report though, we probably shouldn't jump to conclusions. I don't know much about what could cause pulmonary edema, but maybe it was due to something they both ate, or an infection that they both came down with, or something unrelated to foul play.",surprise,6,7,3,3,3
"I think if someone is going to take on that responsibility in raising cattle they should at least know what they are doing. This guy, Bundy, does not care for them. They hardly have food or water. They get no interaction so when they do need to round them up, they're mean. That should be illegal. I'm suprised he has not been caught yet. He is very lucky because when he get caught he will regret not taking proper care of them.",anger,5,5,1,5,6
"I found a story about Kate Beckinsale and her husband, Len Wiseman, they have pulled the plug on their marriage ... TMZ has learned. Wiseman cited irreconcilable differences. His docs state both he and Kate have waived any right to spousal support, and that suggests there's a prenup. They were married in 2004 and have no kids together. TMZ broke the story ... the couple's marriage was on the rocks last November. Len was spotted out with model CJ Franco, and Kate we seen shortly after -- sans wedding ring -- on the red carpet.",sadness,5,4,3,5,2
I think this situation will more or less quickly be resolved. It is just a temporary issue and I really believe the gas prices will go back to normal. I don't think there should be too much to worry about. I remember this happened around the crisis here back in 2009 and everything was settled rather quickly.,sadness,7,7,4,7,7
It's such a shame the man had to shoot the dog.  Labradors in general are decent dogs and not know to attack people for no reason.  He could have shot into the ground or into the air to scare the dog off.  I feel bad for the lady that lost her dog but this is why you keep your dogs on leashes.  If she hadn't let the dog off the leash this probably would not have happened.  It's a terrible and unfortunate situation all around and I hope I never find myself with the same problem.  I'm gonna go play with my dog now and be grateful.,disgust,6,5,3,5,4
After reading how so many people think Trump will ruin this country I think its fair to say some of our most beloved Presidents acted the same why yet we keep them up on pedestals. Today with social media we just see the problems more out in front since nothing is private anymore. I'm older 63 as you know and my mom and granny taught me how to behave. Don't go into a room with some man you don't know. If he tries something tell someone. All these ladies who kept quiet or were paid off in some way are just as big a part of the problem as any man who abuses them. Ladies time for us to take responsible for what happens.,anger,6,7,7,7,6
"You have to read this.  It's unbelievable that people could act so rash and wrong towards another human being, no matter what happened.  If I were in that situation, I'd be so angry and I would want to hurt someone back.  It's hard not to get caught up in the emotion of the situation since so many people got hurt.",anger,7,2,4,6,7
France plans to shut down the jungle as they call it. This was where they kept illegal immigrants trying to make their way to Britain. I certainly feel for anyone looking for a better life and at times wish all countries had open borders as this one isn't so great at times but we do have laws and many immigrants enter other countries legally and I think there needs to be some sort of controls that make the process fair to legal citizens. I feel for the immigrants but it's hard to support their actions when they could also do so legally as opposed to sneaking in by way of hiding in trucks.,anger,7,6,5,7,7
"Lmao why has no one told me about this. This i\should be like public information from insurance companies but of course they are trying the most amount of money off of their customers . Us safe drivers are the reason why they are profitable in the first place, so they could do their part and give us discounts for our safe driving practices",anger,4,6,2,7,7
"I don't know what more it's gonna take for meat eaters to finally get it through their heads that we consume way too much meat. If someone says ""plant based"" anywhere near them they seem to automatically reject it. Agriculture is the main contributor to the destruction of the earth. It's not like people are preaching everyone go vegan, but drastically reducing your intake of meat would help the planet by a huge margin. For whatever reason, they just can't seem to rationalize that simple sentiment.",anger,7,7,4,7,5
Dude I seriously cannot believe what happened at the zoo not too long ago. A kid fell into a moat in May when he fell through the barrier. Wow it must have been so terrifying for the family. Then the gorilla picked up the boy and carried him a little bit. They actually ended up shooting the gorilla which is so sad.,,3,5,3,4,4
I just read an article about the attacks in a syrian town. It sounds horrible what they are going through. It talks about women and children dying. I tried to immagine what it would be like to live in such horror. It mentions many post on social media of pictures and videos. I would be interested in seeing some of the pictures and videos of this violence. Reading stuff like this really makes you appreciate being in America.,surprise,7,7,4,7,5

The law suit is for 5 million dollars.. maybe they can get some money..  I think it's terrible that this product was allowed to be sold.  It is awful when someone thinks something would make them look nice but instead ends up damaging them for life.  Be sure to check the article out.. I think there are some pictures out there too.

There was more bombing over in Syria in the news over the weekend.  There were over 300 casualties including small children.

"The wildlife park offers their help after over half a million supporters signed a petition made by the non-profit organization Animals Asia to demand the closure of the aquarium. If the current owners of the polar bear agree to this offer, Pizza could be moved to a proper sanctuary and his life of misery would end. “The good news now for Grandview is that they now have the chance to put their mistake right,” Dave Neale, Animal Welfare Director for Animals Asia, said in a statement. “Thanks to this incredible offer from Yorkshire Wildlife Park there can be a happy ending and the negative publicity they have suffered can yet be turned into a positive news story.

I thank God because my sisters were born in USA instead of those countries in the middle east who still believe in male guardianship.Can you imagine a woman seeking permission fro a male figure who is a relative and sometimes a son to acquire a passport?that is so bad.I hope the activists will succeed in helping this women because this is so outrageous.,disgust,6,5,6,5,6
"Dude, you won't believe this. A six-year-old girl fell down an elevator shaft and died. The elevator company has to be at fault here, but that won't bring her back! I can't imagine how her parents must feel, looking at my little boy and wondering what it would be like if we lost him in such a horrible -- yet preventable -- tragedy. I feel so bad for the parents, but I wonder if they could have prevented it somehow, and if so, it would be hard not to blame them somewhat for what happened. But that isn't to deflect guilt over how horrible they must feel, as no one wants to lose their child in such an egregious tragedy. I hope you pray for the family with me!",surprise,5,6,4,3,1
"This article I just read is pretty disturbing. It's about a guy who was trying to warm up inside a hot spring that fell into one that was way too hot, and was basically boiled alive. It's sad, and apparently one of the people with him caught it on camera. The really disturbing part comes when the authorities couldn't get to the body because of how hot it was, and when they came back, they discovered that it had dissolved completely. That part creeped me out.",disgust,6,4,1,3,4
"A guy named Collins was charged with stealing nude celebrity photos and videos. While his behavior is clearly unacceptable, one thing to note is the article is calling this a hack. Hacking and nothing is safe, not you, not yours, not your loved ones, is kind of a way to make people afraid and keep reading. In reality, this guy just kinda sent an email to these celebrities and said hey i need your password this is google from google, hurry its an emergency and they fell for it. I feel bad for them, we've all been tricked at least once in our lives by something on the internet, but it isn't like this guy cracked the security of google and we're all doomed.",anger,4,5,1,1,5
"The modeling industry is very different than the rest of the world it seems. I read an article that male models, even the best ones, are paid a fraction of what female models earn. I guess this is because a lot more money is spent by woman in the fashion and personal products industry. The article says more men are grooming themselves and it's starting to bring wages for male models slowly up. I guess that's just business.",sadness,5,5,2,5,6
"Since many of you guys are at the age of having children, I thought this would be something that is important to share. There is a virus called CMV I just read about that is causing devastating consequences in newborns.

Make sure that you wash your hands after being around toddlers, especially if you're pregnant!",fear,5,5,2,5,5

Her poor baby was only 10 months old.  How sad.  They were parked outside of a Dollar General when thankfully someone noticed and called 911.  The grandmother got guardianship over the baby, thank goodness.  The women got booked on neglect and possession, hopefully she stays in there for awhile.",surprise,7,6,1,4,7
There are no words for how much I ignore Trump and his antics. It has made me numb and lose hope in the whole system. I no longer feel anything loyalty for America or its system. I think it is all a sham and no one should have to feel like that about their own country where they pay taxes to live and work and breathe.,anger,7,7,7,7,7
This is so disturbing. It says that they are killing chickens that are still awake during it. It's like they like torturing them. Why can't we be like Europe? In Europe they have rules on how this is supposed to be done. No we just let companies do whatever they like. How hard it is to kill something and make sure it's not awake while doing so?,disgust,4,5,1,2,3
"How can anyone, in this day and age, still believe that climate change is not real? I imagine it's the same people who believe the earth is flat. We should be working towards clean and renewable energy but of course there are fights all across the way because people want to make money. Also replacing infrastructure is hard. But, that's not an excuse when you know that entire parts of the country might expand into a desert. This is especially true of North America.",,6,6,7,6,6
"Holy moly!  It looks as if this trial is getting out of control.  I know that sensational stories have a tendency to get tons of attention, but I can't help but think about the victims in these cases.  I mean, here is a young woman, whole life ahead, who is inexplicably and disturbingly murdered.  There seems to be only circumstantial evidence against the accused and the media is overblowing the story which can really detract from finding the truth!  The victim here is being overshadowed by the gawker phenomenon.  It's sad.  I mean, even the premise sounds... fishy... but instead of talking about that, it looks like it's being sensationalized into some media circus.  It's terrible.  How can they ever get to the truth if the story is corrupted and broadcast to the whole country?",anger,4,7,2,5,7
It's a shame that air pollution has potentially been linked to increased mental damage with young children.  We often don't take into account all the damage that the fossil fuel companies have done to our society.

One involved a violent adult who went on a rampage and shot an ex-girlfriend's child and another person. The other story involved two kids who were left alone in a home that had a lot of guns and one of them ended up shooting and killing the other, claiming it was an accident.

I think we can all take comfort in the fact that the world didn't end that day.  Even with crazy people in charge the earth's people seem to be capable of keeping us all on the right track.  I mainly worry about my own self now.,fear,6,7,6,7,6
It's a shame how troubled the middle east is and has been for the longest time.  I wish we could come to some agreement with the rest of the world on how to realistically handle the multiple situations in the middle east.  I feel that we should pull out and let them handle their problems on their own with only some guidance from us.,surprise,6,4,1,6,5
"Looks like American Apparel is at it again and declaring bankruptcy.  Ironically they are getting bought out by a Canadian company.  I feel sorry for the employees, but its hard to feel sorry for the company since they just dont seem to get it.  I think one chance is fair, but when you have to declare bankruptcy again a year later your management doesnt seem to know what they are doing.  Maybe the company that bought them will finally get it right.",surprise,7,7,7,7,4
"Terrorism has become so commonplace that it does not even alarm me anymore. It is simply just another day in the world that we have come to live in. No one really wants to address the reasons that drive people to terrorism, so I guess we will just continue to let the media sensationalize death and complain about it the next day.",sadness,5,7,4,7,6
Did you see what is going on with all those refugees? They are trying to cross over by water and a lot of them are drowning and there are record numbers for deaths from shipwrecks. Those poor people just want to get away and lead a better life and they all keep dying or continue to suffer. I really wish we could do something for them so they could all live better lives.,surprise,6,4,6,6,6
"The good news is we live in a place that does not have much air pollution. The bad news is that people that have lung cancer that is exposed to air pollution may have a shorter survival time. Air pollution kills thousands of people each year. Researchers claim that the median survival for people diagnosed with early stages of lung cancer is expected to live 3 times shorter amount of time than those that do not. Of course, we all should stay away from cigarette smoke but it is unfortunate that we have air pollution. They can figure out a way to get to the moon but can not seem to figure out a way to clean our air.",surprise,7,6,5,6,7
"The spread of cholera is very widespread in Haiti. It is costing tons of lives, and money food and doctors are very much needed. Its hard to control like any other high spreading disease. Doctors need resources so much that they cant keep up with ever growing number of patients. They need food, medical supplies, and other miscellaneous equipment that would help them improve their job and combating the outbreak.",surprise,6,7,1,6,7
"Hey, man, don't know if you saw this report on the news, but this article is pretty messed up.  Those poor people were just trying to have a good time and then all hell broke lose.  I remember seeing the news reports and the images were pretty shocking, but the story in this article takes it to another level.  You should read it.  These poor people are going to get paid for sure.  it is funny how the owner had to invoke ""God"" trying to protect his own ass.",anger,6,4,3,6,5
"So I just read an article where 2 friends went diving to a place they shouldnt have and ended up dying. While they were using brand new equipment, I feel like idiots who take stupid risks and go to places where no humans should be, kind of deserve what ends up happening to them. If you dont sky dive, you never have to worry about going splat when your chute doesnt open",surprise,6,3,5,1,1
"It's fascinating to think that these celebrities were fooled so easily by a regular guy. Of course the man's actions are reprehensible, and his jail sentence seems reasonable, but you'd think that celebrities would be more conscious of phishing attacks. Especially since these people gave over their passwords willingly, it's hard to understand the legal precedent for sending someone to jail over this.",,6,5,4,3,3
